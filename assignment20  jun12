1. Closure-based Calculator
def calculate(a, b, operation) {
    return operation(a, b)
}

def add = { x, y -> x + y }
def subtract = { x, y -> x - y }
def multiply = { x, y -> x * y }
println "Addition: " + calculate(5, 3, add)
println "Subtraction: " + calculate(5, 3, subtract)
println "Multiplication: " + calculate(5, 3, multiply)




2. Word Frequency Counter

print "Enter a sentence: "
def sentence = System.console()?.readLine() ?: new Scanner(System.in).nextLine()
def words = sentence.toLowerCase().split("\\s+")
def wordCount = [:]

words.each { word ->
    wordCount[word] = wordCount.get(word, 0) + 1
}

println "Word Frequency:"
wordCount.each { word, count ->
    println "$word → $count"
}




3. Group Strings by Length

def words = ["hi", "hello", "bye", "good", "sun"]
def grouped = [:].withDefault { [] }

words.each { word ->
    grouped[word.length()] << word
}

println "Grouped by word length:"
grouped.each { length, wordList ->
    println "$length → $wordList"
}
